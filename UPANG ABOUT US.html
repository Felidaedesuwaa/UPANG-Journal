            <p>The University of Pangasinan traces its origins back to 1925 when it began as the Dagupan Institute, offering elementary, secondary, and vocational education under the initiative of notable figures such as Francisco Benitez, Dr. Apolinario de los Santos, Dr. Sylvestre Pascual, and Dr. Blas F. Rayos . Over time, the institution evolved and grew in stature, eventually transforming into the PHINMA University of Pangasinan, which continues to build on its foundational mission to provide quality education. Meanwhile, the Pangasinan State University, another prominent institution in the region, was officially chartered much later through Presidential Decree No. 1497, promulgated on June 11, 1978, and became operational shortly thereafter. Although these two universities share a geographical connection, their histories reflect distinct paths of development, with the University of Pangasinan rooted in early 20th-century educational endeavors and the State University emerging from mid-century legislative actions.</p>

                PHINMA Corporation, a proudly-Filipino conglomerate, has a rich history rooted in its mission to make lives better and build the nation through successfully run and profitable businesses. Established as a diversified enterprise, PHINMA engages in various industries, including construction materials, property development, education, and hospitality, primarily operating in the Philippines. A significant part of its legacy lies in PHINMA Education, which focuses on providing accessible education to underserved youth in the Philippines and Indonesia. This initiative began taking shape long before its official expansion, with educational endeavors dating back to institutions like the University of Pangasinan, which started in 1925 as the Dagupan Institute under the leadership of notable figures such as Francisco Benitez, Dr. Apolinario de los Santos, Dr. Sylvestre Pascual, and Dr. Blas F. Rayos. Over nearly two decades, PHINMA Education has tailored its strategies to serve marginalized communities, expanding its reach and impact while celebrating milestones such as the upcoming centennial anniversary of the PHINMA University of Pangasinan. Today, PHINMA continues to empower students through innovative learning approaches and scholarship programs, solidifying its role as a key contributor to education and national development.
